# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Bedtime Website 


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that has multiple options to help you fall asleep at night, ASMR videos, mukbang, ocean noises and boring movies. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I would like my software to lead to a website called Bedtime. Then there will be different sections that you can click that will help with you sleeping better by listening to ocean sounds. There will be a short section about the powers of getting a good amount of sleep. At the end the user will be able to click on a link that will lead them to a short quiz if they choose to take it. It will ask a few questions like what their age and gender is that will calculate the right amount of hours of sleep they should be getting. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I am not collaborating with another classmate

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A website with pictures and has the links to each sleeping solution (even if the links don't work, at least it is on the website)

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
My website has all working links that you can click that will bring you to a different page and present you the solutions. 


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

My website allows the user to input their age and gender that will calculate the right amount of hours of sleep you should be getting. It can also ask you to input a reason as to why you can't sleep, and offer a possible solution. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Ill need to first research the effects of sleep on the body and collect information about what helps people go to sleep. Also the amount of hours each age should be. I'll have to learn how to program quiz that will collect their data and give them a correct answer for their issues.
